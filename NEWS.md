# Vertical Tabs v0.15.0

## 🎉 What's New: Group View & Linked Folder

Introducing **Group View**, a powerful new way to organize and navigate your tabs with three distinct modes:

- **Continuous View:** Scroll seamlessly across multiple tabs as if they were sections of a single long note.
- **Column View:** Arrange tabs side by side with horizontal scrolling for easy comparison.
- **Mission Control View:** Get an overview of all tabs in a group and quickly locate the note you need. *(Double-click or press ESC to exit.)*

With **Linked Folder**, you can instantly open a folder as a tab group—recursively or not. This is especially useful when combined with **Continuous View**. For example, open your **Daily Notes** folder as a group and edit multiple notes in a continuous scroll. Customize the number of notes loaded at a time and their loading order to suit your workflow.


## ✅ Improvements:

- **Smarter Tab Deduplication:** Vertical Tabs now estimates tab creation time, significantly improving deduplication accuracy.

- **Better Internal Link Navigation:** When clicking internal links, navigation now jumps directly to specific sections or headings after tab deduplication.

- **More Precise Deduplication Scope:** Now limited to notes, canvases, PDFs, images, and videos, preventing conflicts with other plugins.
- **Customizing Zen Mode:** Added an option that allows users to decide whether to automatically enable "Show active tabs only" when turning on "Zen Mode."
- **Hover Editor Compatibility:** Hover Editor tabs are now hidden to ensure full compatibility.
- **Smart Composer Compatibility:** Vertical Tabs now works seamlessly with Smart Composer.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes:

- Fixed the "missing field" error in the Dev Console when using the "IDE mode".
- Prevented pinned tabs from being deduplicated.
- Resolved an issue where toggling "Zen Mode" would override the "Show active tabs only" setting.
- Fixed a bug where the "Column View Tab Width" setting was not preserved after restarting Obsidian.
